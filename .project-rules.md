# Git Workflow Example Project Rules

This document outlines the rules and guidelines for working with this repository to ensure consistent and effective collaboration.

## General Rules

1. **Read First, Code Later**
   - Read and understand the project-plan.md document before starting any work
   - Review the current state of the worklog.md to understand what has been done and what needs to be done
   - Familiarize yourself with existing code and documentation before making changes

2. **Worklog Updates**
   - Update worklog.md BEFORE starting a new task, marking it as "In Progress"
   - Update worklog.md AFTER completing a task, marking it as "Completed" with any relevant notes
   - Document any blockers or issues encountered in the worklog

3. **Commit Guidelines**
   - Use descriptive commit messages that clearly explain what changes were made
   - Follow the conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
     - Example: `docs(workflow): add rebase example with conflict resolution`
   - Keep commits focused and atomic (one logical change per commit)

4. **Branch Management**
   - Follow the Master → Dev → Feature branching strategy
   - Branch naming convention:
     - `feature/descriptive-name` for feature branches
     - `bugfix/issue-description` for bug fixes
   - Always create feature branches from the latest Dev branch
   - Keep branches up to date with their parent branches

## Workflow Rules

1. **Starting New Work**
   - Create a feature branch from the latest Dev branch
   - Update worklog.md to reflect the new task
   - Push the branch to remote with tracking: `git push -u origin feature/name`

2. **During Development**
   - Commit frequently with descriptive messages
   - Pull changes from Dev regularly to stay up to date
   - Resolve conflicts promptly if they arise

3. **Before Merging**
   - Ensure your branch is up to date with Dev
   - Prefer rebase over merge to maintain a clean history
   - Test your changes thoroughly
   - Update documentation as necessary

4. **Completing Work**
   - Submit a pull request from your feature branch to Dev
   - Request review from team members
   - Address any feedback
   - Update worklog.md to reflect completion

## Documentation Standards

1. **Markdown Usage**
   - Use proper markdown formatting for readability
   - Include diagrams where appropriate using Mermaid syntax
   - Structure documents with clear headings and sections

2. **Code Examples**
   - Include complete, runnable examples
   - Comment code examples thoroughly
   - Indicate expected output where relevant

3. **Diagrams**
   - Use Mermaid for Git workflow diagrams
   - Ensure diagrams are clear and accurately represent the workflow
   - Include explanatory text around diagrams

## Repository Structure

Maintain the following directory structure:
```
/
├── project-plan.md
├── worklog.md
├── .project-rules.md
├── git-workflow-guide.md
├── /examples/
│   ├── basic-workflow/
│   ├── merge-workflow/
│   └── rebase-workflow/
├── /diagrams/
│   └── [diagram source files if needed]
└── /scripts/
    └── [interactive demonstration scripts]
```

Following these rules will ensure a smooth and effective collaboration process throughout the project.
